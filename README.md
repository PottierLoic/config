# dotfile

Theses are my nvim and wezterm configurations.

There are two scripts:
- `install_term.sh` install wezterm, a Nerd Font and my configuration.
- `install_nvim.sh` install neovim and my configuration. (It make a backup of any previous config)

Execute `install.sh` to setup everything at once.

> [!NOTE]
> This config is probably not well done and I suggest anyone that would like to take inspirations from it to just follow neovim and plugins documentations directly :)
